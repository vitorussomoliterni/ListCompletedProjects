# ListCompletedProjects
Script that checks for completed projects on our network drive and outputs a CSV file. 

Simple app written in C# and .NET, to scan the office network drive and check the local mysql server for completed projects not yet archived.
It's a very barebone app because it is intended to be used just by the IT people in the office.
